# Network_standardisation 

Code for analyses and figures in "Network organization in proportionally thresholded connectomes is persistently related to overall functional connectivity across standardization approaches".

We looked into the dependence of network organisation on overall functional connectivity. More specifically, we standardised the connectomes using mean functional connectivity regression or global signal regression to remove individual differences in mean functional connectivity. We investigated the effect of such methods on (i) the group differences between in network organisation between autism spectrum disorder patients and typical controls, (ii) the correlation between the measures of network organisation and mean FC, and (iii) diagnosis classification using support vector machines.
